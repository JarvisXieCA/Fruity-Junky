Hey! I'm Fin and thank you for dowloading my Pixel Platformer Assets pack!
These assets are free to use and yours to keep! As long as you credit me in your game.
I originaly made these assets for Gamemaker Studio 1 or 2 to be used in a platform game, for advice on how to use sprites or create a platform game in
general, look up HeartBeast on YouTube!

Many Thanks- Finlay John-Baptiste :)
